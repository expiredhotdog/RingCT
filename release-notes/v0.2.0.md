Any proofs, signatures, etc produced in prior versions should be assumed to be incompatible with this release!

**Breaking changes:**
* `random_scalar` and `random_point` functions replaced with `Random` trait containing the `generate` method
* `ECDHPrivateKey` and `ECDHPublicKey` are now traits which extend `Scalar` and `RistrettoPoint`, respectively
* Removed `sign_and_sort` method from CLSAG and MLSAG
* Removed "to_bytes" as an optional feature; this can no longer be disabled
* Sha256 replaced with blake2b

**New features:**
* Added `send` and `receive` methods, which automates "sending" to an address. Lower-level APIs remain for building custom protocols.
* Added "transaction" example of a (heavily simplified) transaction protocol
